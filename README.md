## Greetings! Happy to have you here 🤓

#### Story time 🍿

  I'm **Rebeca** and I moved to London last year from Copenhagen, where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship and worked as a market researcher.
  
  Once I moved to London I wanted to explore something new, exciting, and challenging. 
  I got myself into programming, learning the basics on [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).
  
  Slowly but surely I built up my first [Portfolio](https://rebeca-august.github.io/portfolio/) and I started to call myself a web-developer.  🥳 
  Now, one year later I have one main goal 👉 to make a career out of my passion. 🧡
  
   
   #### This is my long story short. I would love to hear/read yours. 📝
