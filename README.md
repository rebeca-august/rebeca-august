## Hello there! Happy to have you here 🤓

### Story time 🍿

  I'm Rebeca and I moved to London last year from Copenhagen, where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship and worked as a market researcher.
  Once I moved to London I wanted to explore something new, exciting, and challenging. 
  
  I got myself into programming, learning the basics on [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).
  
  Slowly but surely I built up my first [portfolio](https://rebeca-august.github.io/portfolio/) and I started to call myself a web-developer.  🥳 
  Now, one year later I have one main goal and this is to make a career out of my passion.
